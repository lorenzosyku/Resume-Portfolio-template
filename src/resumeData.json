    "bio": "Hi there! I am Lorenzo! I've been coding for over 7 months now. I started coding after a friend told me about it. Along the journey I realised my passion for problem-solving. With this passion, I coded my first app, which is a tip calculator that we could use at work so every busboy, food-runner and waiter would know immidiately how much they made that night. 4 months ago I joined the Papafam community, led by Sonny and Jay, and after working with their materials I feel confident enough to lunch my own website, where  I will display all the coming projects! Stay tuned WEB 3.0 is coming!",
